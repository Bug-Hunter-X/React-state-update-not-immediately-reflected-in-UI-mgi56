# React State Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React where a state update might not be immediately reflected in the UI. The issue is not specific to TailwindCSS but can appear when using it along with React.  The problem relates to how React's virtual DOM and reconciliation process interacts with state changes.  This example showcases a typical scenario and a solution.

## Problem:

The counter increments, but at times, the visual update might lag, or the UI may not show the updated counter immediately.

## Solution:

The provided solution uses the functional `useState` hook's ability to accept a function instead of a direct value for the new state. This ensures that the React state update mechanism works correctly.
